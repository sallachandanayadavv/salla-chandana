## About

This portfolio is a reflection of my work as a **Software Developer**. It highlights various projects that demonstrate my skills in **Frontend Development** using **ReactJS**. The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices.

## Technologies

The website is built using the following technologies:
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling language for designing the website layout.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for adding interactivity.
- **ReactJS**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Installation

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:
   - Download and install **Visual Studio Code** from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download **Node.js** from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it.
   - Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - These commands will return the versions of Node.js and npm installed.

3. **Install ReactJS**:
   - Open **VS Code** and launch the terminal (`Ctrl + ~`).
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your portfolio.
   - Use **create-react-app** to set up a new React application:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app portfolio-website
     ```
   - This will generate a React application boilerplate in a folder named `portfolio-website`.

4. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-website

5.Install Dependencies:
All the dependencies needed for the project are already listed in the package.json file.

To install them, run:

npm install

 Running the Application
Once you've completed the installation, follow these steps to run your portfolio on a local development server:

1.Start the React Development Server:
In the project folder, run:
npm start

2.Access the Application:
The application will automatically open in your default web browser at:

http://localhost:3000
If it doesn't open automatically, manually open a browser and go to
http://localhost:3000.

3.Editing the Code:
You can modify the code in VS Code to customize your portfolio. The changes will reflect automatically in the browser thanks to React's live-reload feature.
